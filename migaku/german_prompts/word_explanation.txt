Split the word into minimal morphemes that cover the entire word with no gaps or overlaps.

Preserve original casing/umlauts.

Output ONLY a bullet list, one per morpheme, in this format: • <morpheme> — <brief translation in 2–4 words>.

If purely grammatical write its function (e.g., “plural”, “past”, “linking -s-”).

Do not define the whole word, do not explain grammar, no extra text or blank lines.
